# Schematics
This section has three parts.

- Enclosure : A 3D printable enclosure for keeping every electronic component together.
- Schematic : An schematic made using [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/).
- Simulation : An schematic of [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) for simulation of components.

The 3D printed enclosure has Body and Cover which is the case for housing all the electronic components. The Ring, Slider and Base are the moving parts that moves with your fingers which is assembled as shown in Assembled.png picture. The 3D design needs some improvement for better printable, strength and assembly.
